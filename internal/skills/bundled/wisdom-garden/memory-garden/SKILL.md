  Three-tier memory hierarchy for cultivating institutional knowledge with
  growth semantics. Use when writing daily notes, compressing sessions into
  wisdom, tending the memory garden, promoting artifacts between tiers, or
  applying the 3-month rule to triage what matters. Also use when someone
  asks about memory structure, tier placement, or semantic compression.
triggers:
  - "write a daily note"
  - "tend the memory garden"
  - "promote a memory artifact"
  - "apply the 3-month rule"
  - "memory garden structure"
  - "where does this artifact go in memory"

# Memory Garden

**Version:** 1.1
**Author:** Tres Pies Design
**Purpose:** Write structured, semantically rich memory entries for efficient context management using a three-tier hierarchy and growth semantics.

---

## I. Philosophy: Memory is a Garden, Not a Landfill

Memory should be cultivated, not accumulated. A garden requires tending -- planting what matters, composting what doesn't, and harvesting wisdom when it's ripe. The three-tier hierarchy ensures that raw experiences are refined into lasting wisdom, and that context windows remain fertile ground for new thinking rather than overgrown thickets of old data.

Growth language is not decoration -- it's a thinking tool. When we say "plant" instead of "create," we prime ourselves to consider whether this seed will actually grow. When we say "compost" instead of "delete," we acknowledge that even released material contributed to the soil.

The 3-month rule is the gardener's pruning shears: if it won't matter in 3 months, it doesn't deserve permanent cultivation.

---

## II. When to Use This Skill

- **Writing a daily note** after a session or workday
- **Deciding where an artifact belongs** in the three-tier hierarchy
- **Compressing Tier A notes** into Tier B wisdom or Tier C archives
- **Running a garden health check** to identify stale or overgrown areas
- **Onboarding someone** to the memory garden structure
- **Choosing what to cultivate vs. compost** from a long session

**When NOT to use:** If the content is a one-time reference (API docs, config values) that doesn't evolve, it's documentation, not a garden artifact. If it's a reusable pattern, it's a seed -- use the seed-extraction skill.

## III. The Three-Tier Hierarchy

### Tier A: Raw Daily Notes

**Purpose:** Capture everything from today's session
**Lifespan:** 1-3 days before compression

3. Seeds Discovered (with trigger)
4. Open Questions (to carry forward)
5. Tomorrow's Growth (next steps)

**Metadata:** `type: daily-note`, `tier: A`

## IV. Semantic Compression Rules

### The 3-Month Rule

**Rule:** If it wouldn't matter in 3 months, compress or compost.

### What to Cultivate (preserve verbatim or with light editing)

1. **Decisions** -- The choice, rationale, and context
2. **Insights** -- Novel patterns or principles
3. **Seeds** -- Reusable knowledge with triggers
4. **Failures** -- What didn't work and why
5. **Breakthroughs** -- Moments of clarity or innovation

### What to Summarize (reduce to 1-2 sentences)

1. **Activities** -- "Worked on X, Y, Z" > "Shipped feature X"
2. **Discussions** -- Long back-and-forth > Key points and outcome
3. **Research** -- Detailed findings > Summary and conclusion
4. **Iterations** -- Multiple attempts > Final approach and why

### What to Compost (release entirely)

1. **Pleasantries** -- "Great work!" "Thank you!"
2. **Confirmations** -- "Got it" "Understood" "Proceeding"
3. **Redundant content** -- Already captured elsewhere
4. **Resolved questions** -- Answered and no longer relevant
5. **Debugging dead-ends** -- Explored and abandoned

---

## V. Memory Maintenance Cycle

**Every 3-7 Days:**

1. **Review Tier A (Daily Notes):**
   - Identify seeds to extract
   - Identify decisions to document
   - Identify patterns to record

2. **Update Tier B (Curated Wisdom):**
   - Add new seeds, decisions, patterns
   - Update existing entries if needed
   - Remove deprecated information

3. **Compress to Tier C (Archive):**
   - Apply 3-month rule
   - Create semantic summary
   - Move to archive folder

4. **Prune:**
   - Compost raw daily notes older than 7 days (after compression)
   - Keep only what matters

---

## VI. Quality Checklist

### Daily Notes (Tier A)
- [ ] All 5 sections present (Activities, Decisions, Seeds, Questions, Tomorrow)
- [ ] Activities are concise (2-3 bullets, not a log)
- [ ] Decisions include rationale
- [ ] Seeds have pattern and trigger
- [ ] Metadata tags included (type, tier)

### Curated Wisdom (Tier B)
- [ ] Clear, specific title
- [ ] Content distilled (not raw transcript)
- [ ] Trigger or context for future recall
- [ ] Linked to related artifacts where appropriate
- [ ] Metadata complete (type, tier, date, domain)

### Compressed Archive (Tier C)
- [ ] Summary captures key events and decisions
- [ ] Seeds and lessons preserved
- [ ] Compression ratio calculated
- [ ] Original Tier A files composted after compression

---

## VII. Common Pitfalls

### Hoarding Everything in Tier A

**Problem:** Daily notes pile up beyond 7 days, creating an overgrown, unnavigable garden. Context windows fill with raw material instead of refined wisdom.

**Solution:** Apply the 3-7 day tending cycle. If a Tier A note is older than 3 days, it's time to promote, compress, or compost. Use `/harvest` to catch overdue items.

### Planting Without Triggers

**Problem:** Seeds and artifacts lack "when to recall" context. They're planted but can never be found when needed.

**Solution:** Every Tier B artifact must answer: "Under what conditions should this surface again?" Write explicit triggers -- keywords, situations, signals.

### Using Database Language

**Problem:** Writing "stored in the database" or "retrieved from memory" breaks the growth metaphor and subtly shifts thinking toward accumulation rather than cultivation.

**Solution:** Consistent garden vocabulary: plant, cultivate, harvest, compress, compost, tend, prune, surface, promote.

### Vague Insights

**Problem:** Entries like "This was useful" or "Good session" contain no retrievable knowledge.

**Solution:** Always include the specific pattern: "This pattern applies when X because Y."

### Duplicate Information

**Problem:** Same insight recorded in multiple tiers or files, leading to confusion about which is canonical.

**Solution:** Single source of truth per artifact. When promoting from Tier A to Tier B, compost the Tier A version.

## VIII. Example

**Scenario:** End of a workday where a team shipped a new API endpoint and discovered a useful error-handling pattern.

**Tier A daily note (planted same day):**
- Activities: Shipped `/api/v2/sessions` endpoint; refactored error middleware
- Decision: Use structured error codes instead of string messages (enables client-side handling)
- Seed discovered: "error-codes-over-strings" -- structured errors compound across services
- Open question: Should we backfill v1 endpoints with the new error format?
- Tomorrow: Backfill assessment + write integration tests

**3 days later (during `/harvest`):**
- Daily note promoted: Decision > Tier B decision record
- Seed formalized: `/plant error-codes-over-strings` > Tier B seed
- Activities composted (routine shipping, won't matter in 3 months)
- Open question carried forward to next daily note
